Run the command below to setup the file. Ensure that the yago_full_clean.tsv file is present in the import directory. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-neo4j-on-ubuntu-20-04

Ensure that the rows are separated by files. If not then use the command : 

sed 's/ /\t/g' ./yago_full_clean.tsv> ./yago_full_mod1.tsv

To load the entire yago dataset, need to increase the max heap size :

If it doesn't work then a subset of the data can be loaded.

Open cypher-shell and load the dataset by using the command: 

LOAD CSV FROM 'file:///yago_full_mod1.tsv' AS row FIELDTERMINATOR '\t'
       MERGE(s:Entity {name : row[0]})
       MERGE (o:Entity {name : row[0]})
       MERGE (s)-[:RELATION {predicate: row[0]}]->(o);

To index run :

CREATE INDEX ON :Entity(name);
